  ============================================================
  EduLITE 3-Term Assessment Model
  ============================================================

  Written Works and Performance Tasks are FLEXIBLE.

  They do not have a required count and do not need numbered
  ECR slots.

  Example:

    Written Work:
      Vocabulary Exercise
      Reading Activity
      Essay
      Oral Recitation

  All four are simply written_work assessments.

  Performance Task:
      Science Project
      Group Presentation

  Both are simply performance_task assessments.

  Only Summative Tests and the Term Examination need a sequence:

      summative_test + sequence 1 = ST1
      summative_test + sequence 2 = ST2

      term_exam + sequence 1 = Term Exam
